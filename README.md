This program is an example implementation of a factorization algorithm I created while in university in 2018.
I am now reuploading this with more clear and thorough explanations and documentations.

Given a semiprime number whose leftmost half of digits are the same and rightmost half of digits the same length, it will produce the two factors in a relatively effiecient manner, which is calculating the intersect point of a straight line representing the square root of the semiprime number and a curved line representing a funtion of the semprime number divided by the X variable.

Please see the code and comments within to understand more of the explicit steps I've outlined and commented on in the file itself.
